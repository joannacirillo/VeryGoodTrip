# VeryGoodTrip

VeryGoodTrip is a team project done by six students of the INSA of Lyon.

VeryGoodTrip is an app to help you discover the city of Lyon. Giving the two points you want to travel from and to, the time you want to travel and your interests,
the app computes a path between the two points, passing by points that can interest you.

You can also create an account: it will allow you to set your preferences whenever you want in your account.

To launch the server : node server.js
